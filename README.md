## Epipolar Geometry (2020 coding-style)
Link to report: https://github.com/Phrungck/epipolar-geometry/blob/main/Report.pdf

In this programming task, the objective is to use the OpenCV libraries to perform epipolar geometry and triangulation of two images captured at different camera angles. We aim to fit a fundamental matrix given matched coordinates and perform the same procedure for matches obtained from putative matches from https://github.com/Phrungck/image_stitching.
